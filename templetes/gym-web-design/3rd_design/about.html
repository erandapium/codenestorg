    <p>Despite his cutting stanzas, John Cooper Clarke’s 1978 poem, Health Fanatic, gave a cultural legitimacy to the 20th-century fitness craze. ‘Going to the gym’ is now a well-worn phrase with the 16 per cent of Americans who are gym members; in Britain the figure is 12 per cent. Gyms have become a familiar part of the global urban landscape. Their brightly lit and open facades expose their occupants pounding away on the rows of treadmills and stationary bikes, while listening to their iPods or watching big screens. </p>
    <p>In Britain the history of sport has largely been a product of its social and labour history roots. In more recent years there has been a shift to the cultural turn in order to explore some of the wider meanings associated with sport and physical activities. Eric Chaline¹s engaging and thought provoking history of the gymnasium is part of this growing trend. </p>
    <p>Using a chronological structure, Chaline outlines the origins and meanings of the gymnasium from ancient Greece to the 21st century. He identifies the changing philosophical shifts in the idealisation of the body through exercise and argues that the Greek ideal of masculine beauty remains the basis of western male fitness and attractiveness. </p>
    <p>This ideal has manifested in a number of ways. Since the 20th century, for example, bodybuilding – ‘pumping iron’ – has represented the most extreme form of body culture, while the ‘fitness body’ of today has been a product of a cross-fertilisation between gay and straight men. Throughout, Chaline pays particular attention to the history of same-sex relations through the lens of the gymnasium and its changing body cultures. </p>
    <p>The gymnasium and its accompanying meanings of fitness has served a number of functions, including the shaping of personal identities, entertainment and, occasionally, the needs of the state. Arete, or reaching one’s full potential in life, was the prime objective for those male freeborn citizens of Ancient Greece who had exclusive access to gymnasiums, which were also important cultural institutions. During the Renaissance the relationship between exercise and body culture underwent a revival based around the ‘rebirth of Vitruvian Man’. However, the gym’s modern roots were firmly established in the early 19th century through Friedrich Jahn’s Turnplatz and the state’s increasing need to improve the health of the population for military and industrial production purposes. </p>
